# Sample Quarkus Application for Artemis Testing

This is a sample Quarkus application used to verify connectivity and messaging functionality with **Apache ActiveMQ Artemis**.  
The application exposes a simple REST endpoint that sends a message to an Artemis queue and another endpoint to consume messages, allowing quick functional testing of:

- Broker connectivity
- Authentication
- Message publishing & consumption
- Containerized or local Artemis setup
